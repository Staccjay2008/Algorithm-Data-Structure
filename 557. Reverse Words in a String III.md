#### Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

#### Example 1:
          Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
          Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
          Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

              
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
      newList = s.split()
      for i in range(len(newList)): 
            newList[i] = newList[i][::-1]
      return " ".join(newList)
