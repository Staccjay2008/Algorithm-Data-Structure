Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

his is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

### Note:
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

### Example:

#### Input:  "abccccdd"
#### Output: 7

#### Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

### Answers:

1. Brute force枚举： o(n!)
2. Greedy: o(n)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        freqs = [0] * 128
        
        for c in s:
            freqs[ord(c)] += 1
        
        ans, odd = 0, 0
        for freq in freqs:
            ans += freq & (~1)
            odd |= freq & 1
        
        return ans + odd
